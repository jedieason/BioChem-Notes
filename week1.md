# BioChem Week I
## Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

### Two Amino acids stereoisomers
- **L-amino acids**: Amino group on the left in Fischer projection (naturally occurring).
- **D-amino acids**: Amino group on the right in Fischer projection (rare in nature).

Both are stereoisomers (enantiomers). Gly does not have L/D forms.

### Isoelectric Point (pI)
The pH at which a molecule, typically a protein, has no net charge. At this point, it won't move in an electric field.
$$ pI = \dfrac {pK_1 + pK_2}{2} $$

### Hydropathy Index
A scale that measures the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of amino acids. Positive values indicate hydrophobicity, while negative values indicate hydrophilicity.

### Classification by Hydrophobicity

| Hydrophobic | Hydrophilic |
|-------------|-------------|
| Alanine     | Arginine    |
| Isoleucine  | Asparagine  |
| Leucine     | Aspartic acid |
| Methionine  | Cysteine    |
| Phenylalanine | Glutamic acid |
| Proline     | Glutamine   |
| Tryptophan  | Glycine     |
| Tyrosine    | Histidine   |
| Valine      | Lysine      |
|             | Serine      |
|             | Threonine   |

### Structure Disruptor
#### Proline
Only amino acid which the side chain forms a covalent bond with the a–amino group. Act as a structural disruptor in the middle of regular secondary
structure elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets.

### Branched Amino Acids
Of the essential amino acids, three account for as much as 33% of muscle tissue – leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

### Properties of Amino Acid Side Chains

- The –OH group of serine and the –SH group of cysteine are good nucleophiles and play key roles in enzyme activity.
- Asn (asparagine) and Gln (glutamine) are hydrophilic and tend to be located on the surface of a protein, interacting with surrounding water.
